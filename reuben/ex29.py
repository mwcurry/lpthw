#Study Drills
#1 What do you think the if does to the code under it?
#'If' prints the code below it if the statement is true
#2 WHy does the code under the if need to be indented 4 spaces?
#The indent ensures that the print is subject to the if statement.
#3 What happens if it isn't indented?
#The if statement will print T/F, and the statement won't print.
